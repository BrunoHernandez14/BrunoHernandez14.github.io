        <p>Hello I am Bruno Hernandez and welcome to my website! I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas and am currently a 
            junior at the University of Texas at Dallas pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. Ever since I was a kid I fell in love with 
            programming making my very first meme webpage. That love soon grew into a passion for robotics and machine learning joining every robotics team 
            there was in my middle and high schools.</p>
