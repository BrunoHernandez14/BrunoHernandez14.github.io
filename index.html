        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Bruno Hernandez and welcome to my website! I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas and am currently a 
            junior at the University of Texas at Dallas pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. Ever since I was a kid I fell in love with robotics and AI with my inspiration 
            coming from watching Transformers 1. Soon I started joining robotics clubs and learning how to program with java being my first language. As I started 
            improving my programming skills my love for robotics and AI grew exponentially. Now at the age of 20 my dream is to build my own company that utilizes AI to make people's
            lifes just a little bit easier. This website will document my journey as well as my projects that will help me gain the skills to make my dream possible!</p>
